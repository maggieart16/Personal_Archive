     <p>Mr Foster left them at the door of the Unbottling Room, where the embryos were taken from their bottles to go through the all- important process of passing into the condition of babies, the first real stage on their way through life as human beings. The DHC and his students took the nearest lift and were carried up to the fifth floor.
    INFANT NURSERIES. CONDITIONING ROOMS, said the sign.</p>
   <p>
    The Director opened a door. They were in a large empty room, very bright and sunny. The whole of the southern wall was a single window. Half a dozen nurses, wearing the official uniform of white coat and trousers, with their hair hidden under white caps, were putting out big bowls of roses in a long row across the floor.The nurses stood still as a mark of respect when the DHC came in.
    'Put out the books,' he said.
    In silence the nurses did as he had ordered. The books were put out between the rose bowls - a row of attractive children's books, each open at some brightly coloured picture of an animal or a fish or a bird.
    'Now bring in the children.'
    </p>
    <p>
    The nurses hurried out of the room and returned in a minute or two, each pushing a set of four shelves on wheels. Each shelf, protected with wire nets, was loaded with eight-month-old babies, all exactly alike (a Bokanovsky Group, it was evident) and all (since they were Deltas) dressed in light brown clothes.
    'Put them down on the floor.'
    The infants were unloaded.
    'Now turn them round so that they can see the flowers and books.'
    The babies were turned round. At once they began to move towards the books, attracted by the bright colours and pretty shapes. As they moved, the sun came out from behind a passing cloud. It shone on the roses and on the pictures, lighting them up and making them even more beautiful. The babies cried out loud with pleasure and excitement.
    The Director rubbed his hands with satisfaction. 'Excellent,' he said. 'It might have been done on purpose.'
    Some of the babies were already at their goal. Their little hands reached out uncertainly, touching the roses and the brightly coloured pages. The Director waited till they were all happily busy. 'Watch carefully,' he said. And lifting his hand, he gave the signal.
    The Head Nurse, who was standing at the other end of the room, pressed a switch.
    There was a violent explosion. Alarm bells sounded.
    The children screamed. Their faces were ugly and twisted with fear.

    'And now,' the Director shouted, making himself heard above the noise, 'now we will make the lesson clearer with a small electric shock.'
    </p>
    <p>
    He waved his hand again and the Head Nurse pressed a second switch. The screams of the babies became desperate. Their little bodies stiffened. Their little arms and legs made sudden movements as if they were being pulled by hidden wires.
    'We can send electric shocks all the way through that part of the floor,' shouted the Director in explanation. 'But that's enough,' he signalled to the nurse.
    The explosions ceased, the bells were silent, the little arms and legs stopped moving and the screams grew less desperate.
    'Offer them the flowers and books again.'
    The nurses obeyed; but at the mere sight of the roses and of those pretty pictures of pet animals, the infants drew back in horror and began to cry louder than ever.
    'Notice that,' said the Director with an air of great satisfaction, 'notice that.'
    Books and loud noises, flowers and electric shocks; already in the minds of the babies these pairs of things were connected, and repeated lessons would make the connection permanent.
    'They'll grow up with what at one time would have been called a "natural" hatred of books and flowers. They'll be safe from books and flowers all their lives.' The Director turned to his nurses. 'Take them away again.'
    Still screaming, the babies in brown were loaded on to their shelves again and wheeled out, leaving behind them the smell of sour milk and a very welcome silence.
